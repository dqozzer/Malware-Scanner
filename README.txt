----- Findthatvirus User Guide -----

Firstly download the files from Github and make sure that they are all there. Once that is done, hopefully you are reading this file... Browse to the 'Find That Virus DQ' file in your downloads folder and this will contain multiple files, one of which should
be an executable file named 'findthatvirus' and also you need to locate the file 'virusfiles.txt' before you scan any drive this file MUST be located in that drives home folder for the scan to work, if not the scan will NOT work. Also some files 
are 'hidden' within the Windows OS to change these navigate to the Control Panel > Appearances and Themes > Folder Options > View Tab. Then check the box entitled 'show hidden files and folders' also uncheck any box that mentions hiding system files.
Once you have dragged and dropped (or copy and pasted) the virus text file into the drives home directory for example the C:\ drive, you can start the executable file named 'findthatvirus' this will open up a cmd window asking you to choose the drive you 
wish to scan, follow the on screen instructions. Once you have typed in the drive pressing enter will initiate the scan. It will display each file that it scans on the screen with its corresponding md5 hash. It will display them extremely fast
and look like a flash but if it finds a virus file then the scan will pause for 5 seconds. Once the scan has completed it will display the amount of files scanned and if it has found any viruses it will display how many it has found and also the filepath 
to find each file it can then be deleted if necessary but do not delete any file without first researching what it is. The virusfiles.txt can be updated and if you wish to update it then please email quorolld@gmail.com with an md5 of a known virus file.
